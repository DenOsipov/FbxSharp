FbxObject
    DisconnectAllSrcObject<T> and DisconnectAllDstObject<T>
        what are the failure modes?
        if a single src/dst object fails to be disconnected, that fails the whole thing, right?
        but if a single src/dst object fails to be disconnected, does that stop the process of disconnecting objects after it?
        if so, what is the order in which the objects are considered?
